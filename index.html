      <h3>
       Golden Retrievers were originally bred in Scotland in the late 19th century by crossing the now-extinct Tweed Water Spaniel with a Yellow Retriever and Bloodhound. They were specifically developed to be excellent hunting dogs, especially for retrieving game. Their distinctive golden, wavy, or straight coat requires regular grooming. They shed year-round but tend to shed more heavily twice a year during the shedding seasons. Golden Retrievers are among the smartest dog breeds. They are highly trainable, excelling in obedience and often used as service dogs, therapy dogs, and search-and-rescue dogs. Golden Retrievers are active and playful dogs that need plenty of exercise. They enjoy running, playing fetch, and swimming. Daily exercise is essential to keep them healthy and happy. Golden Retrievers are known for their strong bond with their families. They are highly loyal, often forming deep attachments to their owners and becoming particularly affectionate as they grow older.</h3>
